## AI Assistance (Vibe Coding)

**AI Tool used:** ChatGPT

### Main Prompts
- "Create a Streamlit app that connects to a PostgreSQL Pagila DWH and shows
  (1) rentals by film category as a bar chart and
  (2) rental trends over time as a line chart."
- "Fix Windows issues with pip/streamlit and PostgreSQL connection."
- "Improve error handling and database defaults."

### What worked well
- Using the view `vw_rental_analysis` simplified SQL queries.
- Streamlit allowed fast creation of interactive reports.

### Challenges
- Windows PATH issues with pip/streamlit.
- Correct database name (`pagila_dwh`) and connection setup.
